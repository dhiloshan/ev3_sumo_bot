# Hi Mr. Huang

Our project was developed using the Micropython Extension and the Git Version Control using the VSCode environment, which controls our EV3 robot.

We downloaded the EV3 Micropython software onto the SD card and inserted it into the EV3 robot.

All code commits were made by Dhiloshan (the commit by Terrance was code written by Dhiloshan on Terrance's computer) 
and all of the building was done by Terrance.

**However**, Terrance helped with some of the functionalites and showed me some useful functions in the documentation I could use for my code. 

**Likewise**, I recommended ways to make the robot stronger and did some minor building.

Hope you enjoy!
